### CSS
We provide some css and scss files located in the `css/` folder that has been pulled from our in house framework [Concrete](https://elkfox.github.io/Concrete/). Variables located at the top of the file are the easiest ways to modify the colours of the popup.

#### Table Of Classes

| Class | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| .popup | The parent class of the popup.<br /> Should be added to the starting element of every popup to apply styling.|
| .overlay | When added to the starting element of the div this will open the popup with an opaque background overlay |
| .full-screen | Opens a 100% width and 100% height popup. |
